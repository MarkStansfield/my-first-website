# My Very First Web Page

## Welcome!

### Description of Project

This project documents my initial steps towards the goal of becomming a full stack web developer.

At the time of writing I have learned HTML and CSS principles, in addition to learning how to use the Cloud9 IDE in combination with GitHub and the IDE's terminal to track, modify, implement, and version control changes and updates.

### Moving forward and Project Rationale

Once the course has been completed I will be trained as a full stack web developer that is able to use and apply the tools and languages illustrated on this website.
